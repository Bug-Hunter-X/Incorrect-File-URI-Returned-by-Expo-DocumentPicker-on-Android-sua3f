This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker library and selecting a file from the device's storage.  The file is selected correctly, but the `uri` returned by the library doesn't match the actual file path on the device. This leads to errors when trying to access or process the file using other libraries or functions, particularly when the app is running on a physical device.
